# Feedback on sprint 1

## Some useful git commands
I used these commands to get a quick read on what everyone did. Then I delved into specific files for a closer look.
* git log --all --graph --oneline --pretty=format:"%C(auto)%<|(20,trunc)%an%<(10)%h%<(60,trunc)%s%d"
* git log --all --numstat --oneline --author <author>

## Overall score: 10/10

It looks like you've made good progress, but there's lots of work left to do! I have to confess, I'm a little
concerned that you're going to face a time crunch in getting this project completed. You have to get this done so I
can play it!

I'm a little confused looking at the branches. I'm guessing taking-orders is defunct? And creating server_and_client
is just about the socket and threading test?

## Specific callouts

* I'm not entirely sure who "=" is, but I'm guessing it's Aarna? (I'm inferring this from task #5.) Good job working
  on the client/server interaction. I'm sure that's a fertile ground for learning new skills. I'd love to hear about
  what your journey has been.
* Ananya, it looks like you did a lot of good coding! To make the git log easier to read, you may want to practice
  squashing your commits together before putting your branch up for PR. Let me know if you need help figuring out
  how to do that.
* Riddhi, it looks like you've committed substantially less code so far! I know that sprite sheets can be a time
  sink, but make sure you don't get stuck just working on sprites for the whole project.
