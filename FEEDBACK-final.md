# Final feedback

## Overall score: 10/10

Confession: I'm going on faith here. I wasn't able to run the game on my
computer, so I'm looking forward to see the demo on Tuesday!

## Specific callouts

* You all did a great job learning git! I know it wasn't always easy, but
  looking at your final git log, the commits look reasonable, and you've done a
  good job annotating them with task numbers. You'll be a step ahead someday
  when you get your first jobs as professional software engineers! :-)
* Ananya and Aarna, if I'm reading the logs correctly, it looks like you both
  did prodigous work get this this thing working!
* Riddhi, it looks like you have one branch that hasn't landed yet. Oops?
