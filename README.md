# BetterPapasPizzeria

How does the game work

Chef Levels

•	Toppings – place in the right section 
•	Baking  - has to be for the right amount of time (don’t under/overcook)
•	Cutting – cutting into even slices (# is given)

Waiter/Cashier Levels

•	Getting the order - Customer is talking (a really big text blob scrolls  on the screen – differing speeds for different customers) and then the player must correctly select the specified order to form the info slip. If player misses information than they can ask the customer resay everything – deducts percent from satisfaction
•	Getting the payment - Get card/cash and then give right amount of change 

Ingredients Getter Levels

•	Get eggs by chasing chickens and collecting them when they drop. 
•	Sorta like Minecraft farming – magically it happens really fast, and you need to time it right. Ex. Wheat farm in which you need to harvest the wheat at the ‘right time’ so it’s usable and then re-plant the seeds.

-	If time permits do more (ex. Add another role or Add a chat)
